Windows has a ton of native settings and features that can make it more pleasant and efficient to use.
Below are some of my favorites that I always adjust after a fresh install of Windows.
These are all personal preference, and I show the settings I like, but use whatever works best for you.

This post was written with Windows 11 in mind, so some of the settings may not be available in other versions of Windows, or you may need to access them differently.

As I discover more awesome settings I'll add them here, so be sure to check back from time to time.
Also, if you have a favourite that I don't have listed here, please let me know in the comments below.

## File Explorer settings

### Have File Explorer open to the This PC view

By default, File Explorer opens to the `Home` view, which shows a bunch of things, such as your most used folders and files.
I find that view very cluttered, and often just want to get into the root of one of my drives, so I prefer to start at the `This PC` view.

Below are screenshots of the default `Home` view and the `This PC` view:

![File Explorer Home view](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/file-explorer-home-view.png)

![File Explorer This PC view](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/file-explorer-this-pc-view.png)

To change the default view of File Explorer to `This PC`:

1. In the Start Menu, search for `File Explorer Options` and open it.
1. In the File Explorer Options window, change the `Open File Explorer to` setting to `This PC`.

![File Explorer Options window to change the default view to This PC](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/file-explorer-options-default-to-this-pc-view.png)

### Show hidden files and folders and file extensions in File Explorer

By default, File Explorer will not show hidden files and folders, nor show file extensions for known file types.
I don't like Windows hiding things from me, so I always enable these settings.

Below are screenshots showing how a directory in File Explorer might look before and after making the changes:

![Before showing hidden files and file extensions](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/directory-before-showing-hidden-files-and-file-extensions.png)

![After showing hidden files and file extensions](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/directory-after-showing-hidden-files-and-file-extensions.png)

To enable the settings:

1. Open File Explorer Options.
   - You can search for `File Explorer Options` in the Start Menu, or find it in File Explorer by clicking the `View` tab, then `Options` on the right side (Windows 10), or the `...` button then `Options` (Windows 11).
1. In the Folder Options window, click on the `View` tab.
1. Under `Advanced settings`, find the following settings:
   - Enable `Show hidden files, folders, and drives`
   - Disable `Hide extensions for known file types`
1. Click `Apply` to apply it to the current folder.
1. Click `Apply to Folders` to apply it to all folders.

![Screenshot showing how to enable showing hidden files and file extensions](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/steps-to-show-hidden-files-and-file-extensions.png)

The last step of clicking the `Apply to Folders` button is important so that you don't have to do this for every folder you open.

## Mouse settings

### Show where the mouse cursor is with the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key

If you have multiple monitors, it's easy to lose the mouse cursor.
Windows has a feature that when you press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key, it will show you where the mouse cursor is by briefly circling it.

![Windows showing where the mouse cursor is](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/show-where-mouse-cursor-is.gif)

To enable this feature:

1. Use the Start Menu to search for `Mouse settings`.
1. In the Mouse settings window, open the `Additional mouse settings`, which should pop up the `Mouse Properties` window.
1. Click on the `Pointer Options` tab.
1. Enable `Show location of pointer when I press the CTRL key`.

![Mouse properties window showing how to enable showing the mouse cursor location](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/mouse-properties-window-enabling-show-location-of-pointer-with-ctrl-key.png)

Bonus: See the Microsoft PowerToys section at the end to allow spotlighting the mouse cursor when you press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key twice.

### Make the mouse cursor larger and change the color

Having a large resolution on a small monitor can make it difficult to see the mouse cursor.
I like to enlarge my cursor a bit, and change the color to make it stand out so it's easier to see.

To adjust your mouse cursor settings, use the Start Menu to search for `Mouse pointer size`.
There you can adjust the size and color of the mouse cursor.

![Windows mouse cursor settings](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/mouse-pointer-size-settings.png)

### Disable the Touchpad when using a mouse

When using Windows on a laptop without an external keyboard, I sometimes accidentally touch the touchpad while typing, which causes the cursor to jump around.
To prevent this, I disable the touchpad when a mouse is connected.

To disable the touchpad when a mouse is connected:

1. Use the Start Menu to search for `Touchpad settings`.
1. Expand the `Touchpad` section.
1. Uncheck `Leave touchpad on when a mouse is connected`.

### Change Touchpad triple-tap to right-click

By default Windows opens the Windows search when you triple-tap the touchpad.
That's what the Windows key is for.
Instead, I prefer to have the triple-tap act as a right-click.

To change the touchpad triple-tap to right-click:

1. In the touchpad settings window, expand the `Three-finger gestures` section.
1. Change the `Taps` dropdown to `Right-click`.

![Touchpad settings to disable the touchpad when a mouse is connected and set triple-tap to right-click](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/touchpad-disable-when-mouse-is-connected-and-set-triple-tap-to-right-click.png)

## Taskbar settings

The Windows taskbar has many settings that can be adjusted.

To open the taskbar settings window:

1. Right-click on the taskbar and choose `Taskbar settings`, or you can search the Start Menu for `Taskbar settings`.

![Taskbar settings I always adjust](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/taskbar-settings-to-hide-search-task-view-and-widgets.png)

### Hide the search box from the taskbar

When I want to search, I use the <kbd>Win</kbd> key and start typing, so I don't like the search box taking up space on the taskbar.

In the taskbar settings window, in the `Taskbar items` section, change the `Search` to `Hide`.

### Hide the task view button

I don't use multiple task views, and use <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch between windows, so I hide the task view button.
You can also use <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> to open the task view.

In the taskbar settings window, in the `Taskbar items` section, toggle the `Task view` to `Off`.

### Disable widgets

I don't use the widgets on the taskbar and find them distracting, so I disable them.

In the taskbar settings window, in the `Taskbar items` section, toggle the `Widgets` to `Off`.

![Screenshot showing the widgets, search box, and task view button on the taskbar](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/task-bar-widgets-search-box-and-task-view.png)

### Decide which system tray icons to always show

The system tray is the area on the right side of the taskbar where you can see the time, volume, network status, and other system icons.
There are some tray icons that I always want to see, and others that I don't care about.
You can control which ones are always shown, and which ones are hidden behind the `Show hidden icons` button to save space on the taskbar.

In the taskbar settings window, expand the `Other system tray icons` section, then toggle `On` the apps that you want to always show, and `Off` the ones to hide.

![System tray icons](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/system-tray-icons.png)

You can also simply drag-and-drop the system tray icons to/from the hidden area to control which ones are always shown.

### Shift the Start Menu to the left

Windows 11 moved the Start Menu to the center of the taskbar by default.
I prefer the previous Windows behaviour where it was on the left.

In the taskbar settings window, in the `Taskbar behaviors` section, change the `Taskbar alignment` to `Left`.

### Never group taskbar buttons

I like to see all of my taskbar buttons including their labels, so I disable grouping them so it's easy to see which ones are open and quickly select the one I want.

Here is a screenshot of the taskbar with the buttons combined:

![Taskbar with combined taskbar icons](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/taskbar-buttons-combined.png)

And the same taskbar with the buttons not combined:

![Taskbar with taskbar icons never combined](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/taskbar-buttons-never-combined.png)

In the taskbar settings window, in the `Taskbar behaviors` section, change the `Combine taskbar buttons and hide labels` to `Never`.

![Taskbar settings to never group taskbar icons](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/taskbar-settings-never-combine-taskbar-buttons.png)

## Desktop settings

### Change your desktop background image

By default Windows will often display a different desktop background image each day from Bing.
I actually quite like this functionality for my personal computer, but prefer to have a static image on my work computer where I often do screen sharing.
You may also want to adjust the desktop image if you remote desktop to other computers regularly, so that it's easy to tell when you are working on your local computer or a remote one.

To change the desktop background image:

1. Right-click on the desktop and choose `Personalize`.
1. In the Personalization settings window, click on `Background`.
   1. You could also get here by searching the Start Menu for `Background image settings`.
1. In the `Personalize your background` section, choose `Picture` from the dropdown.
   1. If you want to cycle through multiple images, you can choose `Slideshow` instead.
1. Click the `Browse` button to select a picture or directory from your computer.
1. You may want to change the `Choose a fit` setting to `Fill`, `Fit`, or `Stretch` to make the image look better on your screen.

![Windows background image settings](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/personalize-background-image-settings.png)

## Power settings

### Don't turn off the screen and go to sleep so fast

Windows will often turn the monitor off or put the computer to sleep after a short period of inactivity, such as 5 or 15 minutes depending on if it is on battery or not.
I like to extend this time so that if I walk away from my computer for a little while, it's less likely to be asleep when I come back.

To change the power settings:

1. Use the Start Menu to search for `Power settings` and open the `Power, sleep, and battery settings`.
1. Expand the `Screen and sleep` section if needed.
1. Adjust when the computer turns off the screen and goes to sleep to your liking.

### Turn on enhanced performance power mode

In that same `Power, sleep, and battery settings` window, you can adjust the `Power mode` to prioritize performance over battery life and energy efficiency if you like.

![Windows power settings](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/power-settings.png)

### Turn the computer off when I press the power button

By default, Windows will put the computer to sleep when you close the lid, or press the power button.
I prefer to have the computer actually shut down when I press the power button.
You may want your laptop to do nothing when the lid is closed, so it keeps running.

To change the power button and lid settings:

1. Use the Start Menu to search for `Close lid` and open the `Change what closing the lid does` option.
1. Adjust the `When I close the lid` and `When I press the power button` settings to your liking.
1. Click `Save changes` to apply the settings.

![Power button and lid settings](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/power-button-and-lid-settings.png)

## Windows features

### Show multiple time zones in the taskbar clock

You can configure multiple time zones to show in the taskbar clock when you hover over it or click on it.
This is great if you work with people in different time zones, travel frequently, or are a software developer and just want to know what the current UTC time is 😄.

To add additional time zones:

1. Right-click on the taskbar clock and choose `Adjust date/time`.
   1. You can also search the Start Menu for `Date & time settings`.
1. In the `Date & time` settings window, scroll down and click on the `Additional clocks` section.
1. The `Date and Time` window should open, allowing you to add up to 2 additional clocks and give them friendly names.

![Date and Time settings with additional clocks](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/date-and-time-settings-additional-clocks.png)

The result when hovering the mouse over the clock:

![Hovering over the clock to show additional time zones](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/date-and-time-additional-clocks-hover.png)

And when clicking on the clock:

![Clicking on the clock to show additional time zones](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/date-and-time-additional-clocks-click.png)

### Use the Windows Sandbox to test software and settings safely

Windows includes an app called `Windows Sandbox`.
When you open the Windows Sandbox app, it creates a clean virtual environment that looks like a fresh install of Windows.
Here you can experiment with software, settings, or files without affecting your main system, and when you close the app everything is erased.
This is great for testing software or settings that you're not sure about, without risking your main system.
Just be sure not to save anything important in the Windows Sandbox, as it will be erased when you close it.

The Windows Sandbox app is not installed by default, so you may need to install it from the Windows Features:

1. Search the Start Menu for `Windows Features`, and choose `Turn Windows features on or off`.
1. In the Windows Features window, scroll down and enable `Windows Sandbox`.
1. Click `OK` to install it.
1. Restart your computer if prompted.

![The Windows Features window showing Windows Sandbox enabled](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/windows-features-enable-windows-sandbox.png)

Now search for `Windows Sandbox` in the Start Menu to open the app.

## Registry tweaks that don't have a GUI setting

> NOTE: Modifying the registry can be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing, so be sure to [backup your registry](https://www.tweaking.com/how-to-backup-whole-registry-in-windows-10-step-by-step-guide/) before making any manual changes.
>
> You can try the commands below in the Windows Sandbox first to see if you like the changes.

I provide terminal commands instead of manual point-and-click steps for modifying the registry to help ensure that only the intended keys are modified.
You can run these commands in PowerShell or Command Prompt.

Some commands shown below may need to be ran from an elevated terminal (e.g. run PowerShell as an Administrator), otherwise you may get an error like `Requested registry access is not allowed`.
Also, you may need to restart your computer for some changes to take effect.

If you are curious about the syntax of the registry commands, you can find [the reg.exe MS docs here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/reg).

If you want to easily apply all of the registry tweaks below, simply [download this .reg file](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/All_registry_changes.reg) and double-click it to run it.

### Disable searching the web in the Start Menu search

When I search from the Start Menu, I want it to only search my local machine.

Here are screenshots before and after disabling the web search:

![Before disabling web search](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/start-menu-search-before-disabling-web-search.png)

![After disabling web search](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/start-menu-search-after-disabling-web-search.png)

Run the following command to disable web search in the Start Menu:

```powershell
reg.exe add "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Search" /v BingSearchEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```

To revert back to the default behavior, run:

```powershell
reg.exe delete "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Search" /v BingSearchEnabled /f
```

Note that it also disables Copilot, which may or may not be desired.

### Always open "More options" context menu in Windows 11+

Windows 11 modified the right-click context menu to only show a few options by default, and you have to click "Show more options" to see the rest.
I prefer the previous Windows behavior where all options are shown by default.

Below are screenshots of the context menu before and after running the command.

Default right-click context menu:

![Default right-click context menu](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/right-click-context-menu-default.png)

Right-click context menu with all options shown:

![Right-click context menu with all options shown](/assets/Posts/2025-02-08-Windows-settings-I-change-after-a-clean-install/right-click-context-menu-with-all-options-shown.png)

Run the following command to always show all options in the context menu:

```powershell
reg.exe add "HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}\InprocServer32" /f /ve
```

To revert back to the default behavior, run:

```powershell
reg.exe delete "HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}" /f
```

[Source and more info](https://www.elevenforum.com/t/disable-show-more-options-context-menu-in-windows-11.1589/)

> NOTE: Windows 11 updated to allow pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Right-click</kbd> to show all options in the context menu, so you may prefer to do that over using this registry tweak.

### Speed up the right-click context menu

When you right-click on a file or folder, the `Send to` menu discovers all of the apps and connected devices you can send the file to, before it actually shows the menu.
We can change this so that it does not enumerate devices until you hover over the `Send to` menu.

Run the following command to delay Send To from looking for devices right away:

```powershell
reg.exe add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer" /v DelaySendToMenuBuild /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

To revert back to the default behavior, run:

```powershell
reg.exe delete "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer" /v DelaySendToMenuBuild /f
```

[Source and more info](https://www.winhelponline.com/blog/hidden-registry-settings-sendto-menu-windows-7/)

### Disable delay of startup apps

Windows puts a delay of 10 seconds before it starts launching apps in the Startup folder.

Run the following command to disable the startup apps delay:

```powershell
reg.exe add "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Serialize" /v Startupdelayinmsec /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```

To revert back to the default behavior, run:

```powershell
reg.exe delete "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Serialize" /v Startupdelayinmsec /f
```

## Bonus: Microsoft PowerToys

I was planning to keep this post to only native Windows features and settings, but I couldn't resist including Microsoft PowerToys.
PowerToys is kind of Microsoft's way of quickly experimenting and iterating on features that _should_ be in Windows, but aren't.
If a feature gets popular enough, it may be included in Windows natively.

Microsoft PowerToys is an application that adds a ton of great features to Windows, and it is being updated all the time.

See the [Microsoft PowerToys docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) for extensive documentation on all of the features, and how to install and configure them.

A few of my favourite features are:

- Always On Top: Keep a window always on top of others.
- Find My Mouse: Spotlight the mouse cursor when you press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key twice.
- File Locksmith: Easily unlock files that are in use by other processes.
- Image Resizer: Resize images quickly and easily.
- Color Picker: Get the RGB, HEX, and HSL values of any color on the screen.

You can install PowerToys by running the following command in a terminal, such as PowerShell:

```shell
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerToys --source winget
```

## Conclusion

I hope you found some of these settings and features helpful.
Have a favourite or one that I didn't mention?
Let me know in the comments!

Happy customizing!
