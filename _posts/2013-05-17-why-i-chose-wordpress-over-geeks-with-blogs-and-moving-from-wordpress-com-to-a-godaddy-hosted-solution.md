A while back I wrote about [some reasons why I didn’t like GWB (Geeks With Blogs) and was attracted to WordPress](http://dans-blog.azurewebsites.net/migrating-my-gwb-blog-over-to-wordpress/).&#160; 6 months later and I am confident that I made the right decision.&#160; GWB was good to me, but their UI and features are just too dated and can’t keep up with what WordPress has to offer.&#160; They said that they had hired some developers to improve the site, but it’s been 6 months and I can’t really see a difference.&#160; When I wrote my last post the one thing that I didn’t like about WordPress.com was that I couldn’t find a theme that would stretch the content area to the full screen width; which is pretty essential for me since a lot of my posts involve long code snippets.&#160; I never did find a theme to do this on WordPress.com (although I gave up after a few hours or searching).&#160; Instead I decided to move to hosting my own WordPress instance.

I have a [few](http://www.danskingdom.com) [other](http://www.xnaparticles.com) [websites](http://www.helpfulpctools.com) that I was hosting on my own personal server at home, but decided to move to [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com) for my hosting since they had a half price special and it would cost me less than my power bill to keep my server running (and I already had my domains registered through them).&#160; I opted for the Deluxe package since I have a few websites, and GoDaddy offers up to 25 free WordPress installations with this package, so I have moved my blog from my deadlydog.wordpress.com site to my GoDaddy-hosted blogs.danskingdom.com site.&#160; The migration process should have been painless; just export my deadlydog.wordpress.com site to an xml file (this part was very easy and painless), and then import it into my new blogs.danskingdom.com site.&#160; For some reason when trying to do the import I would often get a “Connection was reset by the server” error.&#160; So it took me probably about 15 tries before it actually imported everything properly; a few times it died half way through the import, but most of the time it would die before the import even started.&#160; Luckily blowing away and recreating an WordPress instance with GoDaddy is easy and only takes about 30 minutes.&#160; Another reason I chose GoDaddy were that their base prices are pretty competitive, plus I consistently receive coupon codes in my email from them for an additional 25% or 30% off (hint, use referral code **WOWdeadlyd** to get 35% off orders on new products).&#160; Also, their customer service is wonderful.&#160; The support I’ve received via email has been only ok, but anytime I’ve actually called in to their support they’ve been awesome and very helpful.

So once I finally got all of my posts migrated to my own hosted instance I could fix some of the things that annoyed me about my wordpress.com site.&#160; First, I’m able to modify the theme’s css directly without paying anything.&#160; This allowed me to go in and stretch the content area to fit the user’s screen.&#160; You can probably tell while reading this that it isn’t perfect; there is some extra space on the right-hand side, but meh, it’s much better than it was.&#160; Second, it allowed me to add advertisements to my site, which help pay for the hosting costs.&#160; You might be thinking, “What? I don’t see any ads”, but that’s because I’ve placed them at the very bottom of the page to be as non-obtrusive as possible.&#160; Third, it allowed me to hook up [Google Analytics](http://www.google.ca/analytics/) to my site so that I can get even more information about my site’s traffic and visitors, and see what search terms were bringing people to my site.&#160; And by hosting my own WordPress instance I can now install any WordPress plugin that I want, instead of only the ones that WordPress.com has allowed.&#160; One thing that I’ve noticed however is that accessing and navigating links on my GoDaddy hosted WordPress site is often slower than it was on WordPress.com.&#160; I’m not sure if this is a temporary thing or what (since I’ve only been hosting with GoDaddy for about a week), but I often notice myself waiting for a webpage to load now, where I never noticed this before with deadlydog.wordpress.com.&#160; However sometimes a page is super quick to load, so it’s not consistent.

One thing that does sort of suck about moving from WordPress.com to my own hosted solution is that I couldn’t figure out how to transfer my site stats across, so my stats for blog.danskingdom.com only start from the day I setup the new blog on that domain.&#160; Another thing that I didn’t realize until after I had setup my new WordPress account was that I would have to pay to have traffic from my old deadlydog.wordpress.com redirected to the new blog.danskingdom.com; it was only $13 for a year though, so that’s not too bad as I’ll likely delete my old wordpress.com site right before that expires.

One other change I had to make when moving from WordPress.com to my own hosted solution was that in order for my code snippets to show up properly I had to install [SyntaxHighlighter Evolved](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/) on my WordPress instance, which was super simple to do, and I can still use the [Source Code Highlighter Plugin for WordPress.com plugin for Windows Live Writer](http://richhewlett.com/wlwsourcecodeplugin/) which is great.

GWB users may have noticed that I still post to GWB with a “Read more at” link that points to the post on my new domain (in fact I went and updated all of my old posts to “read more” at my new domain. GWB doesn’t offer any way to forward my blog with them to a different domain (not even a paid solution like WordPress.com), so updating my old posts with a link to my new domain was the best I could do).&#160; This is because the one and only thing that I’ll miss about GWB is the community.&#160; While double posting (bad I know, but at least I’ve switched to the “Read more at” method rather than double posting the entire post) I found that I would still get more comments on my GWB posts than my WordPress posts.&#160; Did this mean that my GWB posts were getting more traffic though? I can’t tell because GWB doesn’t offer any sort of information or stats about how many visits my site receives, and I can’t hook up Google Analytics or other 3rd party services to it either.&#160; I’m going to continue double posting with the “Read more at” links so that GWB users can still see my post titles on their feeds and don’t miss out on anything I post that they might find useful, as I too often monitor the GWB main page feed to see other code-related posts that I don’t want to miss out on.&#160; Also, by changing to using the “Read more at” convention it allows me to only have to update my one website when I update an old blog post, rather than having to update multiple; this was a major pain point, especially when I needed to use different Windows Live Writer (WLW) plugins depending on which site I was posting code to.

Anyways, these are my thoughts on my blog’s move.&#160; Hopefully it helps you with making a decision about going with GWB or maintaining your own hosted WordPress solution, and whether you choose GoDaddy or not.&#160; Again, use referral code **WOWdeadlyd** to get 35% off your GoDaddy order.
