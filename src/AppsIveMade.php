<h2>DPSF (Dynamic Particle System Framework)</h2>
<p>DPSF is a framework for creating custom particle systems in XNA, which is Microsoft's programming language used to create software on the XBox 360, Zune, and Windows.
You can get more information and download DPSF by going to <a href="http://xnaparticles.com">xnaparticles.com</a>.</p>
<p>Here are two videos demoing particle systems that were created using DPSF:</p>

<h3>What Is Dan's One File Photo Gallery</h3>
<p>Dan's One File Photo Gallery is a way for you to easily display all of your photos on your website.
The only requirements are that you have a website which supports PHP 5. From there just put your photos
and my file on your website and that's it. Just go to the file in your web browser and your pictures
will be displayed.</p>

<p>For example, I have my own webserver so all I had to do was put my Photo Gallery file in my "My Pictures"
folder and point my webserver to the Photo Gallery file, and presto. My entire "My Pictures" collection is
available online. If you do this, you may want to make sure there aren't any "incriminating" pictures
in there, since the Photo Gallery will display all pictures within that directory and all sub-directories :-)</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Automatic thumbnail creation</li>
	<li>Easily change the size of generated thumbnails and how many appear on each row</li>
	<li>Supports .jpg, .png, .gif, and .wbmp pictures</li>
	<li>Looks for pictures in all directories and sub-directories of the directory the file is put in</li>
	<li>Can maintain directory structure as an easy to navigate menu, or can simply display all pictures
		from all directories on one page</li>
	<li>Very configurable via global variables near the top of the file</li>
	<li>Easily change the look and feel of the photo gallery via the CSS style sheet within the file</li>
	<li>Easily specify a welcome message for viewers and explain what your site is about</li>
	<li>It's open source! If you feel like changing something go right ahead</li>
	<li>It's only one file!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Installation instructions are also provided within the file itself at the very top.</p>

<p>
PREREQUISITES:<br />
	1 - PHP 5 or greater installed on the webserver<br />
	2 - Pictures to display are of type .jpg, .png, .gif, or .wbmp<br /><br />

INSTALLATION:<br />
	1 - Drop this file into the directory containing your photos, then simply
		navigate to the file in your web browser. The file display any photos
		found in the directory, as well as any found in its subdirectories.<br />
	2 - The GD Graphics Library must be enabled. This is a standard library
		included with PHP 5, but it is not enabled by default. Simply locate your
		php.ini file (usually in C:\PHP or C:\Windows) and uncomment the line
		";extension=php_gd2.dll" (So it should read "extension=php_gd2.dll").
		If you do not host your own website you may have to contact your
		hosting provider and ask them to do this for you if they have not already done it. If this is
		not enabled then no pictures will show up. So if everything else shows up except the pictures,
		this is likely the problem.
