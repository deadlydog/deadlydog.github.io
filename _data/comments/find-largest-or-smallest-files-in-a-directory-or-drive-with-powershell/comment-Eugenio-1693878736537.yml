message: "With the ketogenic diet, carbs are no longer available so the body begins to \r\nuse stored fat for energy. Whatever we don’t use is put aside \r\nfor later use. You don’t really have to go out of your way to find these foods, and when combined with each other you \r\ncan end up with some amazing dishes. It’s crucial to get \r\nenough of these so that you don’t experience these side effects \r\n- they are temporary, but avoidable. Keto is not just a \r\ndiet, it’s a lifestyle that includes proper exercise (to avoid loss of muscle \r\nmass among many other health benefits), stress management and proper sleep.\r\nMy days are full of creative collaboration and intense teamwork,\r\nso that never leaves me much time to have a good lifestyle in order \r\nto maintain a healthy weight and having Hypothyroidism \r\nacts as a barrier too. Same with \"bad\" fats, like hydrogenated oils and too much inflammatory Omega 6s - disaster.\r\nIn the study, researchers followed seventeen obese men, confined to a \r\nmetabolic ward, for a month while they consumed either a low-carb ketogenic diet or a moderate \r\ncarbohydrate diet on an ad libitum basis (eat as much as desired from foods allowed)."
