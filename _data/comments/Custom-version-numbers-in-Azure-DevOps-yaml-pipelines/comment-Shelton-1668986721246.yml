message: "I believe what you published was actually very logical.\r\n\r\nHowever, think on this, suppose you composed a catchier post title?\r\nI ain't suggesting your information is not good., but what if you added a headline to possibly \r\nget a person's attention? I mean Custom version numbers in Azure \r\nDevOps yaml pipelines - Daniel Schroederâ€™s Programming \r\nBlog is a little plain. You ought to look at Yahoo's front page \r\nand note how they write news titles to grab people interested.\r\nYou might try adding a video or a picture or two to grab readers \r\ninterested about everything've written. Just my opinion, it could bring your posts a little bit more \r\ninteresting."
