  Nice list! I use many of these as well. A tweak I found recently that you may
  appreciate is disabling *Animation Effects* and *Transparency Effects*. Just
  type "Animation" into the start menu to access the appropriate settings panel.
  While I doubt this increases system performance on a technical level, it
  **feels** much snappier and performant. A nice trick for those uninterested in
  some of the GUI fluffyness.
