message: "Thanks @KeithM. Unfortunately, I still haven't done much with AutoHotkey v2 yet. It's been on my ever-growing backlog \U0001F605. If this registry tweak no longer works for AHK v2, have you tried this earlier tweak: https://blog.danskingdom.com/get-autohotkey-to-interact-with-admin-windows-without-running-ahk-script-as-admin/\r\n\r\nCan you report back here if it worked for you or not? Thanks!"
