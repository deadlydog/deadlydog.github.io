message: "Do you know if this technique still works for v2?  The script will not run in v2, but I don't even see the key path in the registry. I could create the path, but if AHK v2 isn't using it anymore it will not help.\r\nSo any chance you can update your post so it is current for v2 ?\r\nThanks"
