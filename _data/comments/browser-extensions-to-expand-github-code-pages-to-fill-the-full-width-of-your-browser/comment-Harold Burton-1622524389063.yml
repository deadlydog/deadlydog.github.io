  Many desperately need an extension to deep-six google doodles! I've read about
  setting flags, etc. but nothing seems to work.Later: Well, I seem to have done
  it, but I'm not sure how. It involved setting every flag suggested on the www,
  as well as multiple Chrome restarts and at least two 5 minute power downs.
  Good luck to all. It can be done.
