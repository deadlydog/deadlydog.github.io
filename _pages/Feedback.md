title: "💬 Feedback I've received from colleagues"
---

In 2021 I started keeping track of feedback that I received from my peers at work.
Unfortunately I wasn't very diligent about keeping track of them years ago, so many are lost, but I was able to track down some from years past.
This page is a compilation of that feedback.

## What my colleagues have to say about me

### 2025-10-30

A shout out from Brenden Petracek in Slack in regards to implementing a quick workaround to allow our clients to be able to log in when Azure Front Door went down.
This quote was part of a longer message from Brenden praising everyone involved:

> @DanSchroeder You're the best!
> As soon as we started cooking on this, I knew you'd be the guy to make it all happen.
> You get incredible things done fast, and it blows my mind every time.
> Thank you.

### 2025-03-10

As part of an organization-wide AI Symposium, I gave a 45 minute presentation on how to use GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio and VS Code for Developers.
Out of 19 responses, my presentation received a rating of `9.37` out of 10.

Here are the anonymous comments from the presentation:

> "Dan's presentation was by far the best / most practical / most instructive (and I'm not even a developer)."

> "The practical tips provided and tricks that were showcased in the Github Copilot for Developers presentation [were most valuable or insightful during the symposium].
> I've already adopted some of them into my daily workflows both professionally and personally."

> "Dan's practical examples and runthrough with GitHub Copilot was great.
> Covered lots of features in a short span while also mentioning the limitations of the tooling."

> "I hadn't explicitly used GitHub CoPilot in Visual Studio/VS Code before so Dan's demonstrations of how easy to use they are was most useful"

> "Dan's presentation was interesting, but seeing how the AI worked made me less interested in using it."

And from the symposium organizer afterward:

> You got a really solid score and plenty of people (in the survey and just through my travels) commented on how valuable it was.
> Great job!
> :celebrate:

### 2024-01-15

Anonymous feedback from 4 individuals on a lunch and learn presentation I gave on Dev Containers and GitHub Codespaces:

Individual 1:

> I really enjoyed how Dan made it so people could follow along in Visual Studio Code and try setting up their own Dev Containers, it really helped to reinforce the concepts that were being presented.
> Dan's presentation skills are always top notch!

Individual 2:

> I really enjoyed the hands on/demo format.
> I'm sure Dan could've presented some slides and called it a day but being able to actually try something is extremely helpful for my knowledge retention.

Individual 3:

> Dan is great at explaining things!
> I thought he chose a really nice level of detail, where I felt like I saw and understood the actual code being used to run and use dev containers, but also wasn't bogged down with unnecessary details.

Individual 4:

> Great balance in supporting explanations with slides and practical demonstrations.

### 2023-05-03

PDLG (Product Development Leadership Group) and Development Leads in Slack:

### 2022-11-08

Steven Swab in Slack:

> I wanted to give @deadlydog-DanSchroeder a shout out for exemplifying a number of our core values.
> He's a `High-horsepower` guy who `Delivers Results` and demonstrates excellent `Servant Leadership`.
> My team was decommissioning an old service, and asked for some help with access to machines I can't access.
> Dan didn't just offer help, but went through and taught me how to remove the service and associated jobs, tasks, etc.
> Despite circumstances not being ideal for its decommissioning, Dan put in extra effort to ensure that the customer wouldn't be impacted and that if they were we could reverse the changes quickly.
> Thank you Dan - The `High-horsepower`, `Servant Leader`, who `Delivers Results`.
> You make all of us at iQ better.

Reply from Maryam Bagherzadeh:

### 2021 Employee of the Year

> In preparing this description of our Employee of the Year winner I asked a few folks for input.
> In each response the central theme was "helping".
> Helping is certainly what I've seen our winner doing very often.
> Never too busy to help others.
> Always looking for ways to give back and to **elevate the people around them**.
> Elevating the people around them is such central factor in everything they do.
> They don't just provide an answer or perform a task, but provide an explanation, or make a video that many people can watch and learn how to solve a similar problem.
> They plan their personal work around how they can use it to enable others to learn and grow too.
>
> Helping people pervades our winners life.
> They maintain a personal blog full of helpful information for anyone on the internet to use.
> The first help I ever received from them was via their public blog, before I even knew we both worked for the same company.
> I've even heard a story from a colleague of how helpful our winner was back in University before either of them even started to work at IQ.
>
> Our winner has been described as selfless, which is plainly true.
> And as a swiss army knife, because they have a solution for all your problems.
> My personal favorite is that they are like Emmett the "Everything is Awesome guy" from the lego movie, happy and always, always a team player.
> As soon as I heard it, it immediately felt right.
>
> Our winner this year has been with IQ for many years.
> For those who were involved in the selection process a very common question was "Why has it taken so long for them to win?".
> The truth is they deserved to win many times.
> But our winner is always helping in the background and never grabbing the spotlight for themselves.
> Clearly this award is loooong overdue!
>
> I want to offer an enormous congratulations and, a bright bright spotlight, to our 2021 Employee of the Year….
> Dan Schroeder.

### 2021 Q4 SLICCE Nomination from Cathy McKay

### From Dexter (circa 2019)

> Dan is always helpful and always provides a ton of insight into what he sees, and where he sees it, so that not only am I getting the help I need, but also learning where to look and what to look for when situations arise.
> I wish everyone provided as much insight and context into the help they are giving, because that in turn allows us to learn and not just be told that it's fixed, thus I can also share that knowledge.
>
> I've had many times in the past where I've required assistance and Dan was the one to help me get to the bottom of the problem I/the client am/are seeing, and every time I come out of the experience feeling like I have gained knowledge which I can use in resolving other issues because I now have a better understanding of how things work, and what they affect.
>
> Dan is a great resource and I appreciate the assistance I get from him in every interaction.

### From Tyler Foraie (circa 2018)

> Dan is the man.
> He's always available to lend a hand, and always jumping in when there is an issue.

>
> I would say his patience is one of his best qualities.
> Even if your not quite sure how to ask for what your trying to do, Dan will work with you to determine exactly what it is you need and help you get there even if it takes a full afternoon.
>
> I believe Dan is an asset to this company in both his knowledge of how things work and how he treats his coworkers with respect.

### From Kelly Jardine (circa 2018)

> WHEN WAS THIS PERSON AT THEIR BEST?
>
> I believe Dan is at his best all of the time.
> For example, the things he accomplishes when he has time to put his head down and solve insane database messes is insane to me.
> But then, you ask him to get on a phone with a Client to explain this insanely complicated task he is taking on and he kills it!
> Dan is a rockstar internally and externally.
> His patience for me and my demanding questions is greatly appreciated.
>
> WHAT DO YOU WISH THIS PERSON KNEW THAT MIGHT CHANGE THE WAY THEY WORK?
>
> Honestly.. I can't think of anything.

> He is a laid-back, considerate person, that doesn't balk under the constant pressure and demands that are constantly demanded of Dev Ops.

> It has been an honour and pleasure to be in his circle while he was manning the helm.

### From Kelly Jardine (circa 2014)

> Dan is always willing to help out with any problem or question someone brings forward.
> Also, Dan is always very thankful to everyone he works with and expresses that all the time.
> It doesn't hurt when he brings donuts for the whole floor either.

### From Julian Rendell (circa 2012)

>Dan always shows great character, and sense of community- from being SLICCE nominator of the year in 2011, to his dedication to making sure the right things end up at the right time in the right place, working, ah, just right.
> He treats all teams and projects, even those in other offices with the same care and attention to detail.
>
> He combines speed and agility to ensure deliveries to customers happen on time (even outside of normal working hours), noticing patterns and pitfalls to lead to innovations that save time and frustration.
> His willingness to listen to both sides of an argument and synthesis even better solutions is remarkable.
> A case in point: he made the "production RQ4 installer" available to the Sprint Enterprise team in Vancouver, making it much easier for our developers to work with RQ4.
> This action has saved the enterprise team a very large number of hours, frustration and headaches.
>
> Dan also takes great care to respect his environment, both colleagues and use of company equipment.
>
> Finally, given all the traits and characteristics exhibited at work, I'm sure Dan very carefully balances his lifestyle to ensure his roles as parent and partner are never neglected.

### From Kathy Chenglath (circa 2012)

> I feel like Dan is someone that is a quiet unsung hero.
> Being the Nominator of the Year last year showed that he always takes the time to recognize his peers when he himself deserves recognition as well.
>
> Dan stepped up to the plate this year to create a Dev Ops group.
> The purpose of the group is to create new ways to make things easier for other developers.
> Not only does this show innovation but it shows great character to want to help his peers so much in their day to day.
>
> Speaking of character, Dan exudes this every time someone asks him for help.
> I can think of countless times where anyone on the team has asked a question that I don't know the answer to and the first person I can think of to pose the question to is Dan.
> And for the most part he always knows the answer!
> He also always shows speed and agility every time as he usually has a response so quickly within the day.
> If he doesn't know the answer, he usually knows who to point you to in order to find that answer.
>
> All in all Dan has proven that he's an important asset to the team that we can all count on and demonstrates the company values effortlessly :)

> He is always thinking of others first, and always makes sure that someone else’s work gets done before his own.
> He’s always putting in extra time to make sure that his own tasks get done, and he’s always taking on extra tasks that the team needs!
> With all the work that we have been putting in for our enterprise clients, Dan has consistently stayed late to get work done on time, and make sure that all teams can continue working without interruption – this affects all RQ teams, including QA and our release team.
> A lot of people have sacrificed because of the deadlines we have, but Dan has been one who has continually stepped up to deliver.
> His work ethic and attitude are great examples for all around.

### Fun fact

For a long while circa 2011 I was responsible for merging our various code branches during a code freeze to create new versions of our flagship product.
That's when the team made this gem 😊
