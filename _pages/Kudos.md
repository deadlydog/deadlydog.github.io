title: "🙏 Kudos and Thank Yous I've received"
---

In 2021 I started keeping track of "thank you" emails and donations that I received for my open source software.
This page is a compilation of that feedback.
It's a nice place I can turn to when I'm not feeling motivated, or when I need a pick-me-up.

## Donations and thank you emails from the community
