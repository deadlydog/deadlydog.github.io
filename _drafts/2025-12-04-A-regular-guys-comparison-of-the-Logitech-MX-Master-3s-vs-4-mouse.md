Ever since I got the Logitech MX Master 3s in December 2023, it's been my favourite mouse of all time, beating out my previous favourites from the 2000s, [the Logitech MX510](https://www.reddit.com/r/MouseReview/comments/1egvuwg/in_light_of_logitechs_forever_mouse_my_mx510_i/) and later [the Logitech MX518](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-MX518-Optical-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B0015R8M7U), which have been discontinued.

But this isn't about those mice; it's about [the Logitech MX Master 4](https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/shop/p/mx-master-4), which was released in October 2024, and comparing it to the MX Master 3s.

I've been using [the Logitech MX Master 3s](https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/shop/p/mx-master-3s) for almost 2 years now.
I got it because I started having wrist pain, and thought a more ergonomic mouse might help.

I first tried [the Logitech MX Vertical](https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/shop/p/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse), but didn't like how I had to move my entire arm to move the mouse.
I then tried the MX Master 3s.
It was super comfortable, and after using it for a couple weeks my wrist pain went away.

I love the MX Master 3s.
After almost 2 years though, it started having flaky issues with the left button clicks.
Sometimes it would not register single clicks, or would double-click when I only clicked once.
It also made dragging-and-dropping very difficult, as most times it would release the drag before I let go of the button.

After some research, I found that this is a common issue with the MX Master 3s, and the typical fix is to replace the button switch, which requires taking the mouse apart and soldering.
While I like to imagine myself as a DIY guy, I've never soldered before and don't have the tools on hand.
Instead, I took the mouse apart and applied a couple pieces of tape to the mouse casing above the switch to increase the tension on it.
I also applied a tiny bit of WD-40 to the switch, [as mentioned on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/logitech/comments/1g0c8kd/mx_master_3s_mouse_switch_replacement/).
This seemed to help, at least for now.

Since the MX Master 4 had just come out, I figured it was a good time to upgrade, as I wasn't sure how long my temporary fix would last.
Unfortunately, it sounds like the MX Master 4 uses the same button switches, so they will likely have the same issue eventually.

MX 4 Pros:

- Haptic feedback is nice, but not really necessary. The only time I notice it is when waking the mouse.
- I like the thumb wheel better. It is more at the tip of my thumb than in the middle by the knuckle, making it easier to use.
- An extra programmable button, which was a main reason for getting it.
- Screws to take it apart do not require removing the feet pads (important since the left/right button switches are prone to failure).
  - All screws are identical. Uses 5 phillips screws. The MX 3s has 5 phillips screws and 1 torx screw, which was annoying.

MX 4 Cons:

- Quite a bit heavier than the 3s. I was getting wrist pain a couple years back, and the 3s alleviated that. After using the 4 for a little over a week, the wrist pain returned.
- The thumb button can be pressed both down or in, so I often press it in by accident when adjusting the mouse to a new position on my desk.
  - In the MX 3s, you have to press the thumb button __down__, allowing you to easily pick up the mouse without accidentally pressing the button.
  - The MX 4 is both heavier and smoother than the 3s, making the thumb slide more when picking it up and forcing you to grip it harder, leading to more accidental presses.
  - I like using the thumb button for media controls, so more than once I accidentally pressed the thumb button while adjusting the mouse position on my desk and started playing music while in a video call.
- The scroll wheel button to switch between ratchet and free-spin modes makes a noticeable click sound (doesn't bother me though)
- Not great polling speeds for high-speed gaming, but that's not a big concern for me as I mainly use it for productivity, and the games I do play don't depend on low millisecond response times.

The feel of the mouse in my hand is very similar.
The MX 3s is a bit grippier due to the rubberized surface, while the MX 4 has a smoother plastic finish.
The shape is nearly identical, with only very minor differences.
If I didn't have them side-by-side, it would be hard to tell which is which, aside from the weight difference and the feel of the thumb button.
If you like the feel of the MX 3s, you'll likely like the MX 4 as well.

## Conclusion

While I quite liked the MX Master 4, especially for the extra programmable button, the wrist pain and accidental thumb button presses were a deal-breaker for me.
If I was still in my 20s and hadn't developed wrist pain, I likely would have kept the MX 4.
