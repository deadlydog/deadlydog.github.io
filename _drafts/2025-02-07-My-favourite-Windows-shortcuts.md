## Keyboard shortcuts (maybe move shortcuts to their own post)



## Taskbar shortcuts

There are a few shortcuts you can use with the task bar:

- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Left-click</kbd>: Opens another instance of the application
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Left-click</kbd>: Opens another instance of the application as an administrator
- <kdd>Shift</kdd> + <kbd>Right-click</kbd>: Show additional context menu options, such as Run As Admin or a Different User

## File Explorer shortcuts

- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>: Go up one level in the folder hierarchy
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>: Go back
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd>: Go forward

In the address bar, you can type:

- `cmd` to open a command prompt in the current directory
- `pwsh` to open a PowerShell 7+ prompt in the current directory, if you have it installed.
- `shell:startup` to open the Startup folder
- `shell:sendto` to open the SendTo folder
- `shell:common startup` to open the Startup folder for all users
- `shell:common sendto` to open the SendTo folder for all users
- `shell:desktop` to open the Desktop folder
- `shell:downloads` to open the Downloads folder

Start with a brief description of the post to entice readers to continue.

Use headers to organize your post, if it's long enough.
Include a TL;DR if appropriate.

End with a brief conclusion.

Your regular markdown goes here. It also supports HTML :)

Try to include at least one image, as it makes preview links more appealing since the first image often gets used as the preview image:

Posts in this _drafts directory will not show up on the website unless you build using `--draft` when compiling:

> bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --draft
